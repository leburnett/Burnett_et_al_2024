function APanalysis(filename,threshold)
% APanalysis a quick tool to determine the number of spikes, their
% latencies and amplitudes, spiking frequency, action potential threshold,
% 50% widths (+errors in this estimate due to sampling). 
% Thresholds are hand-picked, which takes much longer than automatic, but
% is much more reliable.
%
% Argument list is:
% filename - full name of the file with .abf in the end: '123456.abf'
% threshold - minimal voltage for a spike to be considered as action
% potential, not just membrane potential fluctuation. Set this based on
% your recordings (e.g., if all of you action potentials are at least 
% above 5 mV, then pass threshold = 5). By default, threshold = 0.
%
% Manual input will wait for the same number of inputs as the number of
% spikes identified in the current trace. "Enter" key should terminate
% manual input earlier, but might cause error in this script. This issue
% may be addressed later.
